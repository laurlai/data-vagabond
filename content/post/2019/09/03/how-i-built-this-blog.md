I've toyed with the idea of creating my own website for a few years now. I wanted to be able to document my travels as well as generate my portfolio for future job prospects in data science. 

I wanted something I could build myself and can easily maintain as my portfolio evolves. 

## my prerequisites

The only exposure I've had to web development until recently was custom profile development on MySpace in the early 2000s (which involved copying `html` from other sources and modifying the code _ever so slightly_ to fit my needs). I do have general coding experience in other languages, so that's definitely helped me pick things up on a logical standpoint. 

## process

The steps to launch a blog using `Hugo` are relatively straightforward when using the quick start guide. However, because I wanted a look that was all my own, I needed to learn the ropes for creating a custom theme as well. 

This template is heavily influenced by the [Hugo Theme Basic](https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic) theme, [this tutorial](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/), and design elements from [this motherfucking website](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/). 

## what did i learn?

### CSS is *hard*!
