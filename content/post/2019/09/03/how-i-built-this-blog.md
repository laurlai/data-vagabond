I've toyed with the idea of creating my own website for a few years now. The primary purpose of the site is to give a brief overview of my abilities as well as showcase my work in data science. I wanted something I could build myself, but not from complete scratch as that would be too difficult given my (lack of) experience in web development. Around 2006, I spent way too many hours on MySpace "customizing" my profile using `html` snippets from other sources, resulting in a tacky black-and-red color scheme and an absurd amount of sparkly text gifs. 

## process

The steps to launch a blog using `Hugo` are relatively straightforward when using the quick start guide. However, because I wanted a look that was all my own, I needed to learn the ropes for creating a custom theme as well. 

This template is heavily influenced by the [Hugo Theme Basic](https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic) theme, [this tutorial](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/), and design elements from [this motherfucking website](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/). 

## what did i learn?
