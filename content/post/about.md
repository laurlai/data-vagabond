I'm currently an Analytics Engineer at Slate, where I maintain our data pipeline and derive insights on website performance using various data analysis methods. 

I studied Physics at George Washington University culminating in a nuclear physics thesis. I spent two summers exploring particle physics at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) Accelerator and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment CERN. I began my career as a Technology Consultant at Deloitte specializing in data analytics services for the national security and defense sectors. At GXM Consulting, I managed projects in application rapid prototyping and developed data analysis frameworks to measure defense agency performance. 

**Some things I 💖:** 🌱 plants, 🛠 DIY projects, 🐈 and my cat, Atlas.
