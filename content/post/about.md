I earned a Bachelor of Science in Physics at George Washington University culminating in a thesis on nuclear physics. I spent two summers exploring the science of particles at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) Accelerator and European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). Through conducting physics research, I learned the basics of programming and data analysis on the fly.

I began my professional career as a Technology Consultant at Deloitte working in national security and defense. I grew deeply interested in how to shape unstructured data into compelling visualizations and stories. I had opportunities to learn about machine learning, data analysis in R, and Tableau development.

At GXM Consulting as a Data Science Engineer, I developed data analysis frameworks to measure the performance of a newly-established defense agency. As a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) for a software development project, I implemented DevOps processes and advanced the customer's organizational strategies.

I'm currently an Analytics Engineer at Slate.

Some things I love:

🌱 plants,

🛠 DIY projects,

🐈 and my cat, Atlas.
