I'm currently an Analytics Engineer at Slate, where I maintain our data pipeline and analyze article content performance, audience segmentation, and revenue optimization. 

I studied Physics at George Washington University culminating in a nuclear physics thesis. I spent two summers exploring particle physics before becoming a Technology Consultant. At Deloitte, I specialized in data analytics services for national security and defense. At GXM Consulting, I developed data analysis frameworks to measure defense agency performance and managed a rapid prototyping sofware project. 

**Some things I 💖:** 🌱 plants, 🛠 DIY projects, 🐈 and my cat, Atlas.
