I'm currently an Analytics Engineer at Slate. I maintain our data pipeline and analyze article content performance, audience segmentation, and revenue optimization. 

I studied Physics at George Washington University culminating in a nuclear physics thesis. I spent two summers exploring particle physics before becoming a Technology Consultant at Deloitte. I specialized in data analytics services for national security and defense. At GXM Consulting, I developed data analysis frameworks to measure defense agency performance and managed a rapid prototyping software project. 

**Some things I 💖:** 🛹 skateboarding, 🌱 plants, 🛠 DIY projects, 🐈 and my cat, Atlas.
